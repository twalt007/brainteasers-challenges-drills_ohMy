// Write two functions reverseArray and reverseArrayInPlace. 
// The first, reverseArray, takes an array as an argument and produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order. 
// The second, reverseArrayInPlace, does what the reverse method does: 
// it modifies the array given as argument in order to reverse its elements. (does not push to a new aray, but changes elements in first)
// Neither may use the standard reverse method.
